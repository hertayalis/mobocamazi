The teenager allegedly killed his friend but points to an officer instead.</p><p class=Zg>Lakeith Smith, 18 years of age, was charged and sentenced to 65 years in prison for killing his friend, A’Donte Washington in Alabama. Originally, he was given a plea deal of 26 years, but after received 65 years. To make matters worse, the murder was not committed by the teen, but by an Alabama, police officer.</p><p class=Zg>According to different news channels, Smith was one of some teens who attempted a robbery in houses located at Millbrook. The response of the officers was quick, and one of Smiths apprentice fired the first shot, which escalated to a shootout between the robbers and the policemen.</p><p class=Zg>The incident happened in 2015 but sparked fury on the internet today for being posted on the social media platform Twitter. User @okayplayer tweeted the news and quickly got responses from different people talking about injustice.</p><p class=Zg>Twitter user @SwitchedgearZ shared his thoughts through a response saying “He was 15 years old. He shouldn't have been tried as an adult. He was a minor under the "age of majority." He should have been tried in court as a juvenile, but he's black and the cop killed his friend. So someone had to take the fall. And although I agree that if you broke the law, and you were caught attempting to rob a place you should face the repercussions. However, 65 years for a 15yo juvenile is excessive! And the cop that killed the person walks free?! I don't see the "Justice."</p><p class=Zg>Additionally, some people raised the fact that Smith was a black American teen, which is widely known in America to have a harsher and unjust treatment, especially when violating the law. Jeree Thomas, director of Campaign for Youth Justice, spoke out saying,</p><p class=Zg>“This is certainly an uncommon case. The defendant’s accomplice wasn’t even involved in the killing, it was a third-party, but they prosecuted him anyway.”</p><p class=Zg>As was mentioned by Thomas, cases like these are no longer new in the area. There are seminars that teach young black Americas, as young as the age of 4 or 5, to respond in a certain manner when confronted by a police officer, just because of their skin color. Certainly, there is still a form of discrimination circulating in America.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmppbnBianq0wM6rsGaslZq7br%2FEp6ueppOasW5%2Fj2awnpmiqHqxvsispqdlkWK6b7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f125825-story-teen-sentenced-30-years-prison-a-m-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f125825-story-teen-sentenced-30-years-prison-a-m-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f125825-story-teen-sentenced-30-years-prison-a-m-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f125825-story-teen-sentenced-30-years-prison-a-m-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f125825-story-teen-sentenced-30-years-prison-a-m-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f125825-story-teen-sentenced-30-years-prison-a-m-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./adam-macdougall-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./adam-macdougall-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Adam MacDougall Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mohamed-al-fayed.html>Mohamed Al-Fayed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mohamed-al-fayed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
