<time>08 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>The bandleader of The Late Show, Louis Cato, was not present. The performer revealed his whereabouts and gave a rendition of Michael Jackson’s “I’ll Be There” in response to the outpouring of concern.</strong></p><p>Louis Cato has probably appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The Late Show Band, the show’s house band, is led by him. The multi-instrumentalist is proficient in a variety of musical instruments, including bass, low brass, guitar, percussion, and others. The performer is a skilled singer and songwriter.</p><p>joined the program in the middle of 2022. Louis Cato was an important band member, so his absence from The Late Show was notable. Fans of the Portuguese-born musician are curious about his whereabouts and the reason he was absent from his usual spot on the renowned CBS program. Let’s find out more information on this.</p><h2><span id=Louis_Cato_Is_He_Sick_What_happened_to_the_bandleader_Update_on_Health_and_Illness>Louis Cato: Is He Sick? What happened to the bandleader? Update on Health and Illness</span></h2><p>On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’s 8 November episode earlier this week, viewers asked about Louis Cato because he wasn’t where he usually was. One fan asked on Twitter, “#Colbert where is Louis Cato, and why is the drummer upfront?” Just now, someone else wanted to know where Louis Cato was.</p><p>In response to the intense concern and curiosity of his followers, Cato sent a letter about his location on Instagram on November 8, 2022. The statement from the multi-talented artist began,</p><p><strong>“Happy Monday, you all.” So to speak, fresh after a fantastic weekend filled with positive energy and, dare I say it, unforgettable cooperation.</strong></p><p>It appears that I needed to have my yearly coronavirus shot. “Sit yo self down,” he said further. Despite having a bad cold, I’m fine. “I am appreciative of my friends and colleagues.” Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that The Late Show Bandleader’s absence from his assigned time was caused by illness. The musician appears to be recovering and will soon attend the event once more. He had an excellent musical performance and covered Michael Jackson’s “I’ll Be There” after realizing how much his fans missed him.</p><h2><span id=The_Professional_Career_of_Louis_Cato>The Professional Career of Louis Cato</span></h2><p>Because his mother played the church organ, Louis Cato began playing music when he was a young child. Before leaving Boston’s Berklee College of Music in 2004, the jazz and R&B performer attended for two semesters. At the North Sea Jazz Festival, he met Marcus Miller, a talented American musician and record producer, during a jam session.</p><p>The music aficionados subsequently embarked on a lengthy tour together. When Colbert’s Late Show began in 2015, Louis joined the band Stay Human (formerly The Late Show Band). When the band’s real leader, Jon Batiste, was absent, he also filled in as interim bandleader.</p><p>The former bandleader took a break from the conversation program in the summer of 2022. Cato was chosen to serve as the next band leader of the House band when it was announced in August of that same year that Batiste would not be coming back.</p><h2><span id=Clan_Louis_Cato>Clan Louis Cato</span></h2><p>Despite being born in Portugal, Louis Cato spent his formative years in Albemarle, North Carolina. His mother played the church organ, but nothing is known about his father. Parents must have supported the musician’s career. People must also be proud of what he has accomplished. In terms of his personal life, Louis Cato was a happily married man who had two children and raised a nice family of four. The names of his wife and kids have not been made public. However, the Catos must have a lovely life outside of the public eye.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>performer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Aria Shahghasemi</a></h3>Aria Shahghasemi- Biography Aria Shahghasemi is a well-known Iranian-American performer and television personality.
