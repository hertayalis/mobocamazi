While 32-year-old real estate broker Shayne and 29-year-old consulting manager Natalie did make it to the altar, due to a massive fight the night before,<strong> they did not exchange vows</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fabc024c20da-shane-z.jpg><p id=emtp-QeDtaTv data-wc=3><strong>Shayne and Natalie</strong></p><p id=eZz1cBxAes47 data-wc=68>As Natalie revealed during the reunion special, the fight - during which Shayne said she was the "worst thing" to ever happen to him - was something of a wake-up call that the pair had big issues they needed to work through. During the reunion, the pair also revealed they <strong>did attempt to date for a while after the camera stopped rolling</strong> but are now no longer together.</p><p id=eVBf3LKgIFUF data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Which couples from Love Is Blind season one are still together?</a></strong></p><h2>Nick and Danielle</h2><p id=eHNXc5pR2Cxv data-wc=86>Nick and Danielle were fairly solid from the start, so it's perhaps unsurprising that the <strong>couple remain happy and together today.</strong> In the lead up to their wedding, there were some doubts and fears between the pair - mainly regarding Danielle's moving into Nick's apartment along with her cat and drum set - but as Nick gushed after their nuptials: "It all worked out the way it was supposed to, and that means I'm a married man. We have 50-some-odd years together and I can't wait."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0aff6b50ac85-danielle-z.jpg><p id=e4a_cM02wBUB data-wc=3><strong>Nick and Danielle</strong></p><p id=esAcIXQxxJP6 data-wc=33>The couple revealed during the reunion episode that over the Christmas holidays,<strong> Nick's uncle surprised her with a family wedding ring</strong>.

They called it quits during their engagement period after some of the issues that first cropped up in the pods proved insurmountable, including their very different religious views. While Shaina is a devout Christian, Kyle considers himself an atheist and Shaina felt that she was compromising "her relationship with God" by dating someone who did not share her views.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/76b519367d24-shania-z.jpg><p id=evV4EaBxV1gM data-wc=3><strong>Shaina and Kyle</strong></p><p id=eNSIhS6_khVS data-wc=50>Kyle dropped a huge bombshell during the reunion episode when he admitted that he felt he should have proposed to Deepti in the pods instead of Shaina. "I wish I saw what was right in front of me," he said, referring to his spark with Deepti. "That's my biggest regret."</p><h2>Abhishek and Deepti</h2><p id=edpgxpxkt_pz data-wc=65>Deepti pulled the plug on her relationship with Abhishek (aka Shake) at the alter, telling the 33-year-old vet and house DJ that she was choosing herself instead of him. Viewers were hardly surprised, and some may have sighed a breath of relief, given the fact<strong> Shake had made it pretty clear that he was not attracted to Deepti despite hitting it off in the pods.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/43c4f26725c3-deepti-z.jpg><p id=e3CvTR1Fs2iX data-wc=3><strong>Abhishek and Deepti</strong></p><p id=eHSmOaWtt6SC data-wc=61>At the reunion, Deepti admitted that other women in the show had<strong> privately told her that Shake was saying unkind things behind her back</strong>, which resulted in her decision to cut things off. Meanwhile, Shake doubled down on his sexist and sizeist comments, which caused host Vanessa Lachey to call him out for "berating every single one of these women physically".</p><h2>Mallory and Salvador</h2><p id=eRwNI4PDLvt_R data-wc=51><strong>Salvador shocked viewers when he told Mallory on their wedding day that he loved her but could not marry her.</strong> Despite exchanging heartfelt vows, when it came sealing the deal with an 'I do', Sal appeared visibly upset and instead said: "I cannot. I feel like I just need more time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/40ed79cf1887-mallory-z.jpg><p id=ecWszAkjRRFDE data-wc=3><strong>Mallory and Salvador</strong></p><p id=e4AQKklWYYWT9 data-wc=32>Like Shayne and Natalie, the pair did decide to keep working on their relationship after the ceremony but ultimately moved on. <strong>As they revealed during the reunion, they are no longer together.</strong></p><p id=ewf2IvZFoop2M data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Love is Blind star pays tribute to partner following backlash&nbsp;" class=hm-link href=#>Love is Blind star pays tribute to partner following backlash&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h2>Jarrette and Iyanna</h2><p id=edgV1rOiuFvq_ data-wc=69>Jarrette and Iyanna are the only other couple who got married in season two of the show, although, as fans will know, their course of love did not run as smoothly as it could have done. Iyanna was not Jarrette's first choice, with the 32-year-old project manager first proposing to Mallory in the pods, and<strong> issues arose when the gang all met face-to-face at the pre-honeymoon trip to Mexico.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/063d1fd06864-garrette-z.jpg><p id=eAN3ZN-WHIQPs data-wc=3><strong>Jarrette and Iyanna</strong></p><p id=eMvMfMfjsPIWV data-wc=37>Fans will be happy to hear that despite their very different lifestyles, <strong>Jarrette and Iyanna have remained married. </strong>Speaking during the reunion, Iyanna said the two have found a healthy balance between going out and staying in.</p><p id=e-cHnUIM21Hty data-wc=40>"We've been finding our balance. We're hyperaware that we're very different — he's extremely extroverted," she said. "This will always be something that we have to deal with, because we're so different. But we have similar values and similar goals."</p><p id=e-HIydoIlBTQ_ data-wc=4><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
