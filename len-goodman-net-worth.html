He is a professional ballroom dancer, choreographer, coach, and television personality. He is best known as the head judge on “Strictly Come Dancing” (UK) and “Dancing with the Stars” (US).</p><p>So just how rich is Len Goodman? He is estimated to have a net worth of $12 million. He has acquired his wealth from his ballroom dancing career, his dance studio in England, and his role as head judge in televised dance competitions.</p><h3>Len Goodman Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>Goodman, born in Bethnal Green, England, is the son of an electrician and of Polish descent. He moved to Blackfen at the age of six where he attended Westwood Secondary Modern School and subsequently joined the cricket team. He first started dancing at the age of nineteen after briefly working as an apprentice welder, in which he used dancing to recover from a football foot injury. He then went on to become a professional dancer, winning numerous competitions such as Dual of the Giants, British Rising Stars, British Exhibition Championships (four times) and World Exhibitions Championships in his late twenties, after which he officially retired. He became a Latin and ballroom dance teacher and proceeded to open his very own dance school named Goodman Dance Academy in Kent, England. In 2009, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer but has been treated through surgery.</p><p>Goodman’s television appearances include hosting a three-part British Broadcasting Compamy (BBC) documentary series on the voyage and sinking of Titanic as part of its 100th anniversary, which aired on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the US back in 2012. His other hosting gigs include BBC “Len Goodman’s Dance Band Days”, “Len Goodman’s Perfect Christmas”, “Dancing Cheek-to-Cheek”, “Holiday of My Lifetime”, and “Len and Ainsley’s Big Food Adventure”. He was also a presenter for a radio show on BBC Radio in 2013 and 2014. He also appeared on “Who Do You Think You Are?, where he learned more about his English and Polish ancestry, particularly his great great Polish grandfather who fought in the Polish-Russian war and was awarded for his bravery. In addition, he released several dance instructional DVD’s called “Dance with Len Goodman” and published his own autobiography entitled “Better Late than Never” along with two other books, “Len’s Lost London” and “Dancing Around Britain”. He has also been a spokesman for Farm Foods, appearing in advertisements with the catchphrase “It gets a ten from Len”. His net worth is still growing.</p><p>He has been given awards in recognition for his contributions to dance such as the British Rising Star Award, the Carl Allen Award, and a Lifetime Achievement Award. His work as a judge on “Dancing with the Stars” has also earned him two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Reality/Competition Program. He is still a resident judge on “Strictly Come Dancing” dispelling rumors of him getting axed, and will be returning as judge on “Dancing with the Stars” after one season of absence. His numerous TV appearances, DVD’s, books, and not to mention his dance school has contributed greatly to his fortune.</p><p>Len Goodman is currently married to fellow dance teacher Sue Barrett, who had been in a relationship with him for more than ten years prior to their marriage. This is his third relationship after he married his championship dance partner Cherry Kingston at 28 which ended in divorce, and a long term relationship with a woman named Lesley, with whom he had a son, James William Goodman. James, now 35, following in his dad’s footsteps, teaches ballroom dancing at his father’s dance school.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.955102040816><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Len
