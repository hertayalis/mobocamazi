Her net worth, salary, and other financial details are not, however, correct.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deb86c67c6d8493276f1654c1696bf6b008877cf/0_39_2479_1487/master/2479.jpg><h2>Early Years, Family and Education</h2><p>On December 20, 1990, Lauren Cho, also known as Lauren “El” Cho, was born. She was born in South Korea’s Kyungpook National University Hospital. She also has American citizenship and is of Korean-American heritage.</p><p>The information about her parents and siblings is scarce, though. She has classical training and sings in the soprano range. She also took choir tours in Europe when she was a teenager.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>She obtained her high school diploma from Hunterdon Central Regional High School in 2009. Later, she attended Westminster Choir College to study music education.</p><h2>What is the Professional Career of Lauren Cho?</h2><p>At a secondary school in Irvington Township, New Jersey, Lauren Cho taught music. Additionally, she led a piece of a church choir in New Jersey. Her buddy Len Gherardi’s tattoo parlor Diamond Heart Studios in Flemington, New Jersey, was where she previously interned as an apprentice.</p><p>But in the winter of 2020, she quit her job as a music teacher and went on a cross-country road trip with her buddy Cody Orell. She had been traveling with Orell since they had first met on Memorial Day with the intention of running a food truck when they got to Bombay Beach, California, their final stop.</p><p>By June 2021, Tao Ruspoli’s “The Whole” Airbnb home, which is situated outside of Joshua Tree National Park between Yucca Valley and Morongo Valley, had hired Cho as its private chef.</p><h3>Missing news</h3><p>At the Airbnb where Cho worked, the housekeeper claimed that both Cho and Orell had started drinking earlier in the day and had gotten into an argument when Orell wouldn’t allow Cho leave on his own. Orell asserted that Cho became upset and fled without her phone, food, or drink when he entered the bus at around 3 o’clock.</p><p>Along with other pals, he looked for Cho, and at around 5:13 he made a call to the local sheriff’s office for assistance. Cho’s tracks reportedly were never found by the initial search party, and the tracks found by subsequent law enforcement were the only ones.</p><p></p><p>This led Orell to think that Cho had gotten into a car with someone because Cho had been planning to meet a puzzler later in the week.&nbsp;When she was last seen, she was leaving the area where she was residing. She was last seen wearing a yellow T-shirt and jean shorts and was last seen around Benmar Trail and Hoopa Road, off of California State Route 62.</p><h3>Investigation</h3><p>Using K9 teams as well, police and rescue personnel searched the area on foot. Fixed-wing aircraft were utilized to conduct aerial searches of the region. According to the Morongo Basin Sheriff’s station, the investigation into Cho’s disappearance has been ongoing ever since she went missing.</p><p>The search and rescue team, including the sheriff’s helicopter, continues to think that Cho voluntarily went missing because there are no indications of any crime. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department’s Specialized Investigations branch assisted the Morongo Basin Station in their search for Cho in September 2021.</p><p>Orell and her friends utilized social media to share Cho’s missing poster and posted flyers about missing individuals along Bombay Beach in an effort to draw attention to Cho’s disappearance.</p><p>On October 9, 2021, while looking for Cho, searchers came across unidentifiable human remains in the arid landscape of Yucca Valley’s vast desert. On October 28, 2021, investigators discovered the remains belonged to Cho. Toxicology findings were still being examined as of the date of the announcement to ascertain the cause and manner of death.</p><h2>What was the Relationship Status of Lauren Cho?</h2><p>Until the date, this 30-year-old woman was unmarried and single. She was a lovely, vivacious, and amiable woman. Her personal life is largely unknown, and she was now preoccupied with her job. However, she gained notoriety as a result of her disappearance.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Cho-posing-for-a-photo.jpg alt="Lauren Cho" width=546 height=727 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Body Stats: How Tall was She?</h2><p>Cho had black hair and a set of brown eyes. Aside from this, not much is known about her precise height, weight, dress size, and other details.</p><h2>Social Media</h2><p>This woman was not using any social networking sites at the time of her passing.</p><p><strong>you may also like </strong><a href=# rel=bookmark>Alan Catterall Net Worth, Bio, Early Life, Death, Incident, Relationship Status, Body Measurements, Social Media.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKSRqr%2Bmuoycn6hlnarAqq%2BMrZyam5iav27CyJyroqVdnby4ecOim2armJp6pbXEZq6io5lirqixjKGcop%2BYqXqvsdNmrqiqpJ16s7HLmquip56otaq8jJ6roaaZmLa1xYycmKudlad8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flauren-cho-music-teacher-victim-how-did-she-die-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flauren-cho-music-teacher-victim-how-did-she-die-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flauren-cho-music-teacher-victim-how-did-she-die-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flauren-cho-music-teacher-victim-how-did-she-die-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flauren-cho-music-teacher-victim-how-did-she-die-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flauren-cho-music-teacher-victim-how-did-she-die-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./3532-lykke-li-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./3532-lykke-li-html.html>Lykke Li</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./keegan-michael-key-net-worth-2024.html>Keegan-Michael Key Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./keegan-michael-key-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
