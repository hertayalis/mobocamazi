Apart from this, we couldn’t find any information about them.</p><p>This is not surprising, especially when you consider that they were from an old era where social media presence was a non-existent concept.</p><p>Reports suggest that Jose Andres was the only child. His exploration of the culinary arts began when he was just 15 years old. From then on, he would go on to build a remarkable career that has seen him accomplish great things.</p><p>At one point, he was even on a delegation set up by then-president Barrack Obama to talk about entrepreneurship.
