Thankfully, he didn’t laugh at me! Being the supportive husband that he is, he believed that someday I truly would. Many people said my chances were slim, but I kept persevering and experimenting in the kitchen….using all kinds of Pillsbury products to create unique recipes.</p><p>Finally, in 2009, I felt it was time for me to enter the contest. I spent hours and hours typing in my recipes, submitting 28 original recipes, then crossing my fingers.&nbsp; It was September 1, 2009, and I was sitting in a parking lot about ready to get out of the car when my phone rung. A nice lady introduced herself as a representative from Pillsbury. She then informed me that I had been chosen to be a finalist in the Pillsbury&nbsp;Bake-Off®, with a <strong>chance to compete for one million dollars</strong>. It’s hard to describe and put into words what I felt in that moment. It was surreal and one of the happiest moments of my life. My hard work had paid off and <strong>I was actually going to be IN the Pillsbury Bake-Off®</strong>! I think I cried happy tears for 10 minutes straight.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Melissa-Stadler-Pillsbury-Bake-Off-6.jpg alt="46th Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest with Melissa Stadler displaying her Chorizo Potato Puffy Tacos in Las Vegas in 2013. www.modernhoney.com" width=2635 height=2845 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Now, I went into great detail about what happened next in this post —&nbsp;<span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>My First Pillsbury Bake-Off Experience + Roast Beef and Gorgonzola Hoagies Recipe</a></strong></span>.&nbsp; I go into great detail describing my first experience at the Bake-Off….it was very entertaining, to say the least, and I had an amazing time.&nbsp; When it was over, I was even more determined to make it happen again. I knew it was a long shot as not many people make it in there two times, but I don’t give up very easily.</p><p>It was 2013 and I was living in San Antonio, Texas. The 46th Pillsbury&nbsp;<span>Bake-Off®</span> was announced and I went to work, filling notebooks with ideas. I would literally take notebooks everywhere I went because I never knew when inspiration might strike and I had to be ready.&nbsp; Since we lived in the mecca of Tex-Mex, I wanted to attempt to make a puffy taco using Pillsbury biscuit dough.&nbsp; They turned out the very first time and my kids ate the entire batch, leaving nothing for my husband. I went back to the store and made another batch of Chorizo Potato Puffy Tacos and once again they were immediately devoured by the family.&nbsp; I texted my husband and said, “I have the million dollar recipe.” I felt sure that this was the winner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Melissa-Stadler-Pillsbury-Bake-Off.jpg alt="46th Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest with Melissa Stadler displaying her Chorizo Potato Puffy Tacos in Las Vegas in 2013. www.modernhoney.com" width=2322 height=4128 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Fast forward to three months later….this time it was an email announcing that I was once again a semi-finalist! Woo hoo! But this time something was new — a new public vote was announced and in order to be a finalist to compete for the million dollars, you had to be one of the top vote-getters. I was a nervous Nelly! I had to somehow beg my friends and family to vote for my recipe for two weeks straight.&nbsp; I ended up going on live TV, doing newspaper and magazine interviews, and my kids even drew flyers and handed them out in the neighborhood. I don’t think I slept much during those two weeks.</p><p>It was the <strong>BEST DAY EVER</strong> when I received the word that I was one of the winners and would be competing in Las Vegas for the million dollars. I was ridiculously happy and oh so grateful for my friends who really came through for me!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Melissa-Stadler-Pillsbury-Bake-Off-1.jpg alt="46th Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest with Melissa Stadler displaying her Chorizo Potato Puffy Tacos in Las Vegas in 2013. www.modernhoney.com" width=2750 height=3072 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>You must read this post —&nbsp;<span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>My First Pillsbury Bake-Off Experience</a></strong></span>&nbsp;— to fully understand my feelings going into this a second time. This time I really wanted to get it right. I strategized and went in with a very specific game plan.&nbsp; I was determined that the 46 Pillsbury&nbsp;<span>Bake-Off®</span> was going to be all about fun and soaking up the experience. I wanted to enjoy every minute! If I am being real, it wasn’t about the money.&nbsp; I was just so grateful and honored to be a part of something so iconic.

My game plan was to submit the very first one to the judges.&nbsp; No distractions this time! If you can imagine in your mind, a large ballroom filled with 100 small kitchens, 100 finalists, hundreds of media outlets, cameras, and music — all happening at the same time. The energy was palpable. A good part of the time while I was cooking, I was being interviewed so multitasking was essential.&nbsp; Thankfully, four kids prepared me for this experience!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Melissa-Stadler-Pillsbury-Bake-Off-12.jpg alt="46th Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest with Melissa Stadler displaying her Chorizo Potato Puffy Tacos in Las Vegas in 2013. www.modernhoney.com" width=4608 height=3072 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Just as I started to garnish my Chorizo Potato Puffy Tacos, a large group of media formed around me. My heart was beating out of my chest and I tried to make everything perfect. Everyone was so encouraging and I remember feeling an insane amount of relief come over me as I finished my dish.&nbsp; I walked to the judges’ table to submit it (they can’t see the contestants) and I had the biggest permagrin on my face. I don’t think I stopped smiling for hours! I had done it! No matter what happened, I felt so happy!</p><p>As soon as the clock expired, the music came on and we started dancing to celebrate the experience! What an incredible, life-changing day it had been!&nbsp;To me, it didn’t matter what happened at the awards ceremony that night — I just felt so blessed to be a part of it.&nbsp; I didn’t come home with the million dollars, but I will be forever grateful for the experience.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Melissa-Stadler-Pillsbury-Bake-Off-2.jpg alt="46th Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest with Melissa Stadler displaying her Chorizo Potato Puffy Tacos in Las Vegas in 2013. www.modernhoney.com" width=3148 height=2802 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This is what put me on the path to creating my own food website, Modern Honey, where I can now share my own original recipes.</p><p>Since I have a food blog, I am not able to enter for a third and final time but all of you dreamers out there have a chance because <strong>The Pillsbury&nbsp;Bake-Off® is back!</strong>&nbsp;This year’s Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest grand prize winner will win $50,000, a trip to New York for an appearance on Food Network’s hit show “The Kitchen,” a kitchen makeover from GE Appliances and a feature in Food Network Magazine.

It is so full of flavor! It is usually paired with potatoes in Mexican dishes.&nbsp; I use red potatoes, cut into small bite-sized pieces, onions, and a diced red pepper to bring in even more flavor.</li><li><strong>Use Green Giant Backyard Grilled Potatoes or make your own by sauteeing potatoes until fork tender</strong> —&nbsp; about 15 minutes before adding chorizo. This gives the potatoes time to make the inside nice and tender and the outsides golden brown. I will give you the instructions for both.</li><li><strong>Tear the biscuit dough in half and press until about a 4-inch round.</strong> Saute in a small amount of oil in a skillet or bake until golden brown.</li><li><strong>To freshen up the puffy tacos, make an</strong> <strong>avocado tomatillo crema</strong>.&nbsp; It is made with avocados, tomatillos, cilantro, and fresh lime juice. I added some fresh lime juice and a touch of sugar to the crema to my recipe to give it a little more freshness.</li><li>Garnish with authentic <strong>Mexican crumbly cotija cheese</strong>. It&nbsp;puts them over the top.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Chorizo-Potato-Puffy-Tacos-12.jpg alt="Chorizo Potato Puffy Tacos from Melissa Stadler 46th Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest.
