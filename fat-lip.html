The song begins with the party scene, where the singer, referred to as El Niño, enters and creates a chaotic environment. The next lines describe how the singer never used to be popular and often went unnoticed, but now, he has everything he wants, but he still feels caged. The singer expresses frustration about society's expectations of him and his peers and how he doesn't want to follow their conventions. The chorus reflects the singer's determination to not be a part of society's conformities and not waste his time becoming another casualty.</p><br><p>The second verse talks about how the singer and his friends are often misunderstood and judged by society. They like to have fun at other people's expense and don't care about "act[ing] their age." The third verse is more confrontational, where the singer raps about his dislike for hypocritical people who put down others who are different from them. The last line of the verse reflects on the singer’s recklessness and how others *count on him* never to be "listenin'."<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line
